          Taking over the mobile app project at Built, a visionary financial
          technology company focused on empowering small businesses in Africa,
          was an exciting challenge. With a clear vision of democratizing
          prosperity, Built deployed web and mobile technologies to assist small
          businesses in starting, running, and growing their ventures. Their
          flagship product, a financial record-keeping application, was designed
          to simplify the management of financial data for small business
          owners, facilitating quick, data-driven decision-making. Additionally,
          the app provided access to a curated selection of financial services
          tailored to the specific needs and size of each business.
        </p>

        <p>
          Working in collaboration with the Built Financial Technologies team,
          we embarked on a journey to rebuild the mobile app from scratch. The
          goal was not just to improve the existing app, but to completely
          revamp it, enhancing its functionality, user experience, and overall
          appeal. Through meticulous planning and execution, we transformed the
          app into a powerful tool for small businesses, offering intuitive
          features and seamless navigation. This rebuild was not just about
          improving the app's performance; it was about reimagining its purpose
          and ensuring it met the evolving needs of its users.
        </p>

        <p>
          The results of our efforts were nothing short of remarkable. By
          implementing a comprehensive marketing strategy and leveraging user
          feedback to fine-tune the app, we were able to increase installs from
          a mere 700 to an impressive 50,000. This exponential growth was a
          testament to the app's newfound appeal and usability, as well as its
          ability to truly deliver on Built's vision of democratizing prosperity
          for small businesses across Africa.

          Taking charge of this innovative on-demand service platform, I
          embarked on a mission to elevate its mobile app, web app, and Firebase
          cloud functions. Despite the project not going live due to business
          constraints, my focus was on enhancing app performance, user
          experience, and introducing new features to enrich the platform's
          functionality.

          The existing mobile applications, tailored for iOS and Android, were
          revamped to offer a seamless user experience. I implemented
          optimizations to improve performance and responsiveness, ensuring
          users could easily browse services, view provider profiles and
          ratings, and book appointments effortlessly. Additionally, I
          integrated new features to enhance the overall user journey, making it
          more intuitive and engaging.

        <p>
          On the web dashboard for service providers, I implemented enhancements
          to streamline booking management, appointment scheduling, and
          communication with users. The goal was to provide a user-friendly
          interface that empowered service providers to efficiently manage their
          operations and interactions with customers.

        <p>
          Furthermore, I worked on Firebase cloud functions and Firebase to
          optimize backend processes and improve data management. This included
          implementing new functionalities to enhance system efficiency and
          reliability.

          While the project faced challenges that prevented it from going live,
          the improvements made during my tenure laid a solid foundation for
          future development. The application was poised to revolutionize the
          service industry in Ghana, offering immense value to both users and
          service providers.
